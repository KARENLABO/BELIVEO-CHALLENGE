# Task Manager


## Description: 

As a Software Developer, I want to be able to track all the tasks I have been assigned for the week, so I don't forget any of them. The list should include all the to do and done tasks.


### Acceptance Criterias:

- Having started the application, I want to see two clearly divided sections: to do and done list, and an area to create a new task. 
- Having started the application, when I see the list of tasks, if there's no task, I want to see a clear affordance telling me that the list is empty.
- Having started the application, when I see the list of tasks, it should be organized in this fashion: On the top, the to-do tasks and on the bottom, the done tasks.
- Having started the application and loaded a list of tasks divided on To-do and Done sub-lists, I want each sub-list to be ordered alphabetically.
- Having started the application and loaded a list of tasks and having at least one to-do item on the list, I want it to have a CTA for each to-do item to mark it as done.
- Having started the application and loaded a list of tasks and having at least one to-do item on the list, when I click on the CTA of any to-do task, I want to see how the tasks moves from the to-do to the done list.
- Having started the application, when I fill up the form to create a new task and "save" the new task, I want to see how this new task is added on the list of to-do tasks.
- Having started the application, when I fill up the form to create a new task and "save" the new task, I want the form to be cleaned up.
- Having started the application, when I hit refresh (F5) button, I want the lists of to-do and done tasks to be kept on memory.

### Definition of Done:

- Application build on a Git repo.
- Application created using the last stable react version.
- Application should use react hooks to manage the state.
- Code properly formatted in order to improve its readability.
- Application state saved on local storage.
- Use of Bootstrap components for the visual appearance
